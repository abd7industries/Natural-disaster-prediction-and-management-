FEATURES:

Disaster Prediction: Uses machine learning to predict potential natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes, cyclones) based on environmental and historical data.

Real-Time Alerts: Sends alerts for early warning using trained models and sensor data (simulated IoT).

Risk Assessment Dashboard: Visual representation using graphs, pie charts, and maps to evaluate disaster risk.

Resource Management: Assists in efficient allocation of emergency resources based on predicted severity and location.

ERP Integration Ready: Can be integrated with local authorities’ systems for quick decision-making.

TECHNOLOGY USED:

Programming Language: Python Libraries/Tools:

pandas, numpy – Data processing matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization scikit-learn – Machine learning flask – For web application (optional if you have a UI) smtplib or twilio – Sending alerts Data Format: .csv files for historical and real-time data Platform: GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

HOW IT WORKS:

Data Input: Environmental data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, etc.) from .csv or APIs. Preprocessing: Clean and format the data for ML models. Model Training: A classification/regression model predicts the type and severity of potential disasters. Prediction: When new data is fed, the model gives predictions. Visualization: The results are shown using pie charts, graphs, and tables. Alert System: Triggers a message or alert if a disaster is predicted.

DATA COLLECTION:

Source: Datasets from government agencies (e.g., Indian Meteorological Department), Kaggle, NOAA, or simulated sensor data.

Format: CSV files containing historical data like temperature, rainfall, seismic activity, wind speed, etc.
